lbd (load balancing detector) detects if a given domain uses DNS and/or HTTP Load-Balancing
(via Server: and Date: header and diffs between server answers).

This is useful for pentests and for curious people. ;)

lbd in action looks like this:
[sb@ge.mine.nu]$ ./lbd www.map24.de

lbd - load balancing detector 0.1 - Checks if a given domain uses load-balancing.
