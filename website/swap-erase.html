<H1>It was integrated into portage. You just had to set RC_SWAP_ERASE="yes" in /etc/conf.d/rc but it was removed again. :(</H1>


<B>Installation:</B>
wget http://ge.mine.nu/rc_swap_erase.patch
wget http://ge.mine.nu/halt.sh_swap_erase.patch

patch /etc/init.d/halt.sh < halt.sh_swap_erase.patch
patch /etc/conf.d/rc < rc_swap_erase.patch

<B>Uninstall:</B>
patch -R /etc/init.d/halt.sh < halt.sh_swap_erase.patch
patch -R /etc/conf.d/rc < rc_swap_erase.patch

I hope this will be added to baselayout soon!
