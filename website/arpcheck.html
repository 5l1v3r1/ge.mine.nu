<H2> <A HREF="code/arpcheck">arpckeck v1.8</A> (235 Downloads)</H2>
arpcheck checks /proc/net/arp for MAC/IP combinations and compares them to a static or dynamic MAC list.<BR>
If something does not fit, you'll get an alarm which will also be logged. You can also run custom scripts.<BR>
<BR>
This is useful, if you're a router with multiple interfaces (e.g. WAN, LAN, DMZ) and want to check<BR>
if anyone from your clients is evil and does some arpspoofing (mitm) or changes his IP.<BR>
<BR>
<H3> Features of ARPcheck: </H3>
 - static mode (using a maclist in shorewall style)<BR>
 - dynamic mode (learning network config)<BR>
 - single mode (just run once and show the results)<BR>
 - logging functions (you can also turn this off, which would not be wise)<BR>
 - calling external scripts, see the examples (e.g. injection of iptables rules)<BR>
 - you can specify different logfiles for every type of logging event<BR>
 - detects lan to lan scans (you can specify the interfaces to check and threshold - you also can turn this on/off)<BR>
   ( only useful if you have multiple interfaces )<BR>
 - blacklist support (you can specify the interfaces to check - you also can turn this on/off)<BR>
 - whitelist support (you can specify the interfaces to check - you also can turn this on/off)<BR>
 - nice colored output (you can turn this on/off)<BR>
 - should run on any linux distro (kernel >= 2.4)<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Usage:</H3>
<PRE>
       ./arpcheck {switches} // when ran without switches, the normal config in the header of the tool is used.
                    -nd      // no dynamic learning
                    -ns      // no static MAClist
                    -nc      // no colors
                    -nb      // no blacklist checks
                    -nw      // no whitelist checks
                    -nS      // no scan detection
                    -s       // single run, just show results and quit
                    -h       // this help
</PRE>
 <B>Commandline does not support all switches!<BR>
 It's the best idea to edit the file and change the settings in the header to fit to your network!<BR>
 I suggest running it in a screen, because you can attach/detach all the time to see what's going on:<BR>
<BR>
 screen -dmS arpcheck ./arpcheck</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>MAC list</H3>
The MAC list is shorewall compatible, it's in the format:<BR>
<PRE>
 [Interface] [MAC] {IP}
 IP is optional!

 Example for a MAC list:
 eth2          00:11:22:33:44:55               # you can add comments after "#"
 eth2          00:de:ad:be:ef:00               192.168.13.37 # MAC/IP combo will be used
 eth2          de:ad:be:ef:be:ee               #192.168.69.69 IP commented out, only MAC will be used
 #eth2         de:ad:73:50:ba:be               # this line will be completely ignored

                  - added logging functionality
 29.06.2005: v1.1 - uses /proc/net/arp directly (MUCH faster)
                  - changed output, added counter
 06.07.2005: v1.2 - changed the comments, added the header
                  - added "-single / -s" switch, just run the checks 1 time and do not run an endless loop
                  - now using multiple interfaces, specify them in INTERFACES (separate via space)
                  - added free line when sleeping
 13.07.2005: v1.3 - added script which gets called, if attack is detected
                  - added some comments
                  - added pidfile (/var/run/arpcheck.pid)
                  - added MAC blacklist, you can turn logging on/off for this via the variable LOGBLACK
                  - added -learn / -s mode (using temporary file ".learning")
                  - added lan scan detection
 14.07.2005: v1.4 - corrected many formating errors
                  - added SCANFACES
                  - added switch to turn colors on/off
                  - custum logging: you can log blacklist-attacks and lan scans to different files
                  - when new MAC/IP learned, we reduce the interval once
 18.07.2005:      - fixed serious bug (when there was only interface+mac on one line an no comment->false detection as attacker)
 27.07.2005: v1.5 - separated the script into functions
                  - dynamic and static mode can now be run simoultanoiusly (some ifaces dynamic, some static, NOT both at once)
                  - added command line switches and help
                  - added -nc switch (no color)
                  - added -nd switch (no dynamic learning)
                  - added -ns switch (no static maclist checks)
                  - added -nb switch (no blacklist checks)
                  - added -nS switch (no scan detection)
                  - added -h / --help switch
                  - changed -single to -s only
                  - changed design, added more colors etc.
 29.08.2005: v1.6 - minor bugfixes
                  - checked performance, fixed bugs which slowed it down a lot
                  - added ".arp" hack: the whole script runs about 500% faster now :)
                  - minor bugfixes
 03.01.06:   v1.7 - releasing under GPL
 26.01.06:   v1.8 - changed checkblacklist() - now you can create blacklists like this:
                    * [iface{,iface,iface}] [mac]
                    * eth0,eth1 00:11:22:33:44:55       if you want to blacklist that mac on eth0,eth1
                    * eth2 00:11:22:33:44:55            if you just want to blacklist that mac on eth2
                    * all 00:11:22:33:44:55             if you want to black that mac on any interface
                  - you may also add commands after the mac, the script will just ignore them
                  - added whitelist, those hosts will be ignored in the other check; you can also log via LOGWHITE
                  - the format for the whitelist is the same as for the blacklist
                  - added -nw command line switch (no whitelist checks)
                  - totally changed the way scripts are called. Now it's WAY more better!
                  - I've created several useful examples for calling external script, they include:
                    * sending SMB/winpopup messages to administrators
                    * sending email
                    * inserting firewall rules with iptables (VERY useful for dynamic learning mode!) -> prevents users from changing IPs :)
                    * starting of special services, if a whitelist mac is seen
                  - I tested the examples and they should work for you with minor changes (change the IPs etc.)
                  - many little bugfixes (e.g. counting lines of *-lists gave "" if there was no such file)
                  - did some code cosmetics ;)
</PRE>

<H3> TODO </H3>
- flood detection/protection (MAC in .flooddetect schreiben, nummer dahinter)<BR>
- fix the dirty checkmacs() hack!<BR>
- timeout bei den learned macs<BR>
- iptables support (block attacking devices) ?<BR>
<BR>
Planned for next release:<BR>
- add timeout for learned macs (RELEARN_INTERVAL)<BR>
- maybe add some variable that ensures you edited to config (like shorewall does), so people don't complain that the tool does not work properly or so<BR>
<BR>
<H3> Runtime </H3>
- of course, this script gets slower, the more entries you have in /proc/net/arp<BR>
- This script was designed for smaller corporate networks with 100 - 250 PCs and is performant enough to handle that ( you should not have a large number of hosts on a single collision domain anyways )<BR>
- as you can see below, it would also be OK for larger networks, e.g. HUGE LAN parties<BR>
- Normal runtime for single check (all checks enabled): ~0.2s on an Athlon XP 2400<BR>
- test: every check enabled, static maclist with 77 entries, blacklist with 1 entry, massive LAN scanning to produce many arp entries:<BR>
-> /proc/net/arp entries vs. time to run: 28248/4.6s, 26610/4.3s, 24877/3.7s, 13566/1.6s, 12033/1.5s, 9697/1s, 7498/0.8s, 3694/0.5s, 479/0.3s<BR>
- I think these runtimes are OK. On a normal LAN you will only have about ~50 entries or so and the script will need 0.2 seconds for all checks<BR>
- You will only have more entries in /proc/net/arp if your box is router and someone scans on an other iface<BR>
