<H2> <A HREF="code/ifswitch">ifswitch</A> - network interface configuration switching tool v0.9.2 (81 Downloads)</H2>
With this tool you can switch your w/lan config very fast; <BR>
It was mainly written to offer very special functions like automatic mac-changing and adding static arp entries, <BR>
which isn't possible with normal tools and startup scripts. It is intended to be used on an "unfriendly" network or in pentests :) <BR>
 <BR>
The following settings can be made in the config file: <BR>
- interface ip (eth0_ip=... or eth0_ip=random or eth0_ip=random#pre.fix) <BR>
- broadcast (eth0_broadcast=...) <BR>
- netmask (eth0_netmask=...) <BR>
- default gateway (defaultgate=...) <BR>
- dns server(s), you can specify multiple lines (dns=ip) <BR>
- mac address; complete, prefix or random (eth0_mac=aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff or eth0_mac=random or eth0_mac=random#pr:ef:ix) <BR>
- static arp entries to prevent arp spoofing attacks, you can specify multiple lines (static_arp=ip#mac) <BR>
- wlan ssid & wep key (eth0_ssid=ssid#key) <BR>
 <BR>
Sample config files: <BR>
<A HREF="code/ifswitch-config1">lan</A>, <A HREF="code/ifswitch-config2">wlan</A> and <A HREF="code/ifswitch-config3">dhcp</A> <BR>
 <BR>
For every configuration, you have to put a file in your CONFDIR (which has to be specified in the header of ifswitch) <BR>
I did it this way, because it allows you to easily create configs for different w/lans which you can send to others using it. <BR>
You wouldn't like to share a huge config file with your private WEP key for your homelan, would you? <BR>
 <BR>
<H3>DO NO FORGET TO CREATE YOUR CONFDIR (/etc/ifswitch)!<BR>
Merged from llog and wlog (previously written for wlan and lan configuration switching).<BR><H3>

<H3>Changelog:</H3>
<PRE>
12.12.2005 - Started coding, alpha ready
13.12.2005 - Fixed bug in addconfig()
           - added showconfig() to the menu
           - added [k]ill dhcpcd to the menu
           - rewritten randmac, now you can use a prefix for randmac -> randmac 00:00:86
           - added RANDOM / randip -> random ips possible, you can also use a prefix -> randip 192.168.0
           - changed parseconfig() and addconfig() to work with randmac/randip
15.12.2005 - added rotate command line switch, useful if you're pentesting ;)
18.12.2005 - confirmed that WLAN mode works fine :)
27.12.2005 - fixed typo with wlan
           - fixed severe error with using macs
03.01.2006 - created killdhcpcd()
           - CONFDIR will now be created if it does not exist and you try adding an entry
           - Released under the GPL-v2
23.01.2006 - removed exit() when iwconfig isn't found: maybe someone just wants to configure a LAN 
31.01.2006 - wrote an ebuild for Gentoo linux
</PRE>
 <BR>
<H3>TODO:</H3> - exclude mode for RANDOM <BR>
- check if RANDOM ip/mac is already there <BR>
- use ip & netmask for calculation of random ip <BR>
- add WPA(2) support <BR>
 <BR>
<H3>Known bugs:</H3> - When creating config files via hand you can get into trouble. Just use the menu dialog to create configs. <BR>
 <BR>
 <BR>
<H2>You should use the menu, especially for creating configs!</H2><H3>Just run ifswitch without any comand line switches:</H3> <BR>

... this will re-run the ifswitch configuration nr 3 every 60 seconds <BR>
This is useful if you want to stay anonymous on a LAN ;) <BR>
