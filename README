Apparently, dyndns.org wants people using their free services to migrate to their payed ones. I was still using http://ge.mine.nu/; I used the domain back from 2005, but didn't update it for a long time alreay. Somehow, I recently lost access to that domain, and I cannot get it back without paying, it seems. I've decided to put the original code and page online on github, so that people can still download my stuff.

I created four folders here; the website and old crap won't be updated; but maybe tor-ctrl, lbd and arpcheck might, so I put them in separate directories. Have fun! 

website
	the complete website

tor-ctrl	
	a commandline tool for executing commands on a tor server via the controlport

lbd	
	detects if a given domain uses DNS and/or HTTP Load-Balancing

arpcheck
	checks /proc/net/arp for MAC/IP combinations and compares them to a static or dynamic MAC list
